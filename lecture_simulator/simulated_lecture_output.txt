00:00 - Hello class, today we are discussing the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
00:06 - My name is Mr. Conway and I will be your instructor for today.
00:10 - This is one of the most important concepts in Linear Algebra.
00:16 - Recall, a matrix is invertible if it satisfies several equivalent conditions.
00:20 - For example, one condition is that the determinant of the matrix is non-zero.
00:24 - Another key point is that an invertible matrix has a unique solution for every vector in R^n.
00:27 - We will also explore the relationship between invertibility and row reduction.
00:30 - If a matrix can be row reduced to the identity matrix, it is invertible.
