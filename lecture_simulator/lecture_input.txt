Hello class, today we are discussing the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
This is one of the most important concepts in Linear Algebra.
Recall, a matrix is invertible if it satisfies several equivalent conditions.
For example, one condition is that the determinant of the matrix is non-zero.
Another key point is that an invertible matrix has a unique solution for every vector in R^n.
We will also explore the relationship between invertibility and row reduction.
If a matrix can be row reduced to the identity matrix, it is invertible.
