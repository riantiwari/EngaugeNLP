00:00 - Hello class, today we are discussing the Invertible Matrix Theorem.
00:05 - My name is Mr. Conway and I will be your instructor for today.
00:08 - This is one of the most important concepts in Linear Algebra.
00:12 - Recall, a matrix is invertible if it satisfies several equivalent conditions.
00:18 - For example, one condition is that the determinant of the matrix is non-zero.
00:24 - Another key point is that an invertible matrix has a unique solution for every vector in R^n.
00:29 - We will also explore the relationship between invertibility and row reduction.
00:34 - If a matrix can be row reduced to the identity matrix, it is invertible.
